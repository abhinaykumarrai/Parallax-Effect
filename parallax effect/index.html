            <div class="text">
                <p>After more than eight years of shenanigans involving candy people, alternate universes, vampires,
                    nearly 3,000 wiki pages worth of lore, some highly unusual exclamations (“Mathematical!”), and
                    bacon pancakes, Cartoon Networks beloved Adventure Time is coming to a close.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Since its debut in 2010, the series has evolved into one of the most popular and influential programs
                    in the channels history. Despite being first and foremost a kids show, it built a sizable fan base
                    among older audiences and gained mounting psychological and even philosophical weight over its
                    10-season run. The September 3 series finale marks the end of an era in imagining new storytelling
                    possibilities, not just for cartoons but for TV in general.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Adventure Time spans nearly 300 11-minute episodes involving hundreds of distinct characters — so
                    its no easy feat to describe. But in brief, it takes place 1,000 years after a nuclear apocalypse
                    known as the “Mushroom War” warps the Earth into a fantasy landscape; its main setting, the Land of
                    Ooo, is populated by offbeat creatures and people made of candy, fire, or “lumpy space,” among other
                    things.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Cycling,[1] also known as bicycling[2] or biking,[3] is the activity of riding a bicycle or other
                    type of cycle. It encompasses the use of human-powered vehicles such as balance bikes, unicycles,
                    tricycles, and quadricycles. Cycling is practised around the world for purposes including transport,
                    recreation, exercise, and competitive sport.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies
                    to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second
                    Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New
                    Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000
                    bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's march or "roll" through Malaya in
                    World War II. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne
                    "Cycle-commandos" with folding bikes.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Parachuting and skydiving is a method of transiting from a high point in an atmosphere to the ground
                    or ocean surface with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent using a
                    parachute or parachutes.For human skydiving, it may involve a phase of more or less free-falling
                    (the skydiving segment)
                    which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to
                    terminal velocity.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>In the U.S. during the 1970s, the sport averaged 42.5 fatalities annually. In the 1980s, the average
                    dropped to 34.1, and in the 1990s, the average decreased to 32.3 deaths per year. Between 2000 and
                    2009, the average dropped to 25.8 and over the eight years after 2009, the annual average declined
                    to 22.4 fatalities (roughly 7.5 fatalities per one million jumps). In 2017, members of one
                    organization, the United States Parachute Association (USPA) reported 2,585 skydiving injuries
                    sufficiently severe to require resort to a medical care facility.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                    board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                    surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can
                    also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore,
                    or in wave pools.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                    several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples
                    of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often
                    surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a
                    surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
                    Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard,
                    either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even
                    standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding
                    inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the
                    surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the
                    purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally
                    has one strap over it to fit on one hand.</p>
